# Receipt Scanner 

Receipt Scanner is a cross-platform mobile app that allows you to scan your receipts and track your spending habits and budget. It is developed using React Native framework and uses various modules to access the camera, extract text, store data, and display charts.

#  Receipt Scanner 
It has three main screens: Home, History, and Settings. I’ve integrated the React Native camera for scanning receipts, and I’ve also installed Text Recognition using React Native ML Kit to extract data from the receipts. Additionally, I’ve integrated the Expo image picker, which allows users to select an image from their device’s library. Furthermore, I’ve imported essential hooks like useState, useRef, and useEffect also I used Api from taggun in additional I used AI helped for refactoring the code and from my professor.
